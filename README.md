This is the recreation of the Jobstore website, for the purpose of Jobstore assessment only.

## Improvements

In the original website, there are quite a lot of spaces that can be used to the fullest potential. So in my recreation, 
I made it into grid style for a modern approach and also to utilize the spaces properly.

Here's the list of improvements I made:
- Upcoming event highlighted at the top with countdown.
- Instead of multiple carousels, I arranged all into one single carousel with auto scroll so the overall page looks cleaner.
- I've added a filter field so the user can easily filter by category, location or salary range.
- I've relocated the blog posts below the filter field and only three latest posts will be shown.
- All the fields are visible upon landing page so user doesn't have to scroll far.
